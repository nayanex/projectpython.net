## Exercise 1

Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension `hpp` to the extension `h`. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. 

```python
filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
newfilenames = []
for filename in filenames:
    if ".hpp" in filename[-4:]:
        newfilenames.append(filename[:-2])
        continue
    newfilenames.append(filename)

print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
```

## Exercise 2

Let's create a function that turns text into **pig latin**: a simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. For example, `python` ends up as `ythonpay`.

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  # Separate the text into words
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    # Create the pig latin word and add it to the list
    say += word[1:] + word[0] + "ay "
    # Turn the list back into a phrase
  return say[:-1]
		
print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

## Exercise 3 

The permissions of a file in a Linux system are split into three sets of three permissions: `read`, `write`, and `execute` for the `owner`, `group`, and `others`. Each of the three values can be expressed as an `octal` number summing each permission, with `4 corresponding to read, 2 to write, and 1 to execute`. Or it can be written with a string using the letters `r`, `w`, and `x` or `-` when the permission is not granted. For example: `640` is `read/write` for the `owner`, `read` for the `group`, and `no permissions` for the `others`; converted to a string, it would be: "rw-r-----" `755` is `read/write/execute` for the `owner`, and `read/execute` for `group` and `others`; converted to a string, it would be: "rwxr-xr-x". Write code to convert a permission in octal format into a string format.

```python
def octal_to_string(octal):
    result = ""
    value_letters = [(4,"r"),(2,"w"),(1,"x")]
    # Iterate over each of the digits in octal
    for permission in [int(n) for n in str(octal)]:
        # Check for each of the permissions values
        for value, letter in value_letters:
            if permission >= value:
                result += letter
                permission -= value
            else:
                result += "-"
    return result
    
print(octal_to_string(755)) # Should be rwxr-xr-x
print(octal_to_string(644)) # Should be rw-r--r--
print(octal_to_string(750)) # Should be rwxr-x---
print(octal_to_string(600)) # Should be rw-------
```

## Exercise 4

The group_list function accepts a group name and a list of members, and returns a string with the format: group_name: member1, member2, â€¦ For example, group_list("g", ["a","b","c"]) returns "g: a, b, c". Write code to do that.

```python
def group_list(group, users):
  members = ", ".join(users)
  return group + ": " + members

print(group_list("Marketing", ["Mike", "Karen", "Jake", "Tasha"])) # Should be "Marketing: Mike, Karen, Jake, Tasha"
print(group_list("Engineering", ["Kim", "Jay", "Tom"])) # Should be "Engineering: Kim, Jay, Tom"
print(group_list("Users", "")) # Should be "Users:"
```

## Exercise 5

The guest_list function reads in a list of tuples with the name, age, and profession of each party guest, and prints the sentence "Guest is X years old and works as __." for each one. For example, guest_list(('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")) should print out: Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef. Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer. Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer. 

```python
  def guest_list(guests):
    for name, age, profession in guests:
      print("{} is {} years old and works as {}".format(name, age, profession))

  guest_list([('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")])

"""
Output should match:
Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef
Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer
Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer
"""
```

## Exercise 6: Joining Lists

A professor with two assistants, Jamie and Drew, wants an attendance list of the students, in the order that they arrived in the classroom. Drew was the first one to note which students arrived, and then Jamie took over. After the class, they each entered their lists into the computer and emailed them to the professor, who needs to combine them into one, in the order of each student's arrival. Jamie emailed a follow-up, saying that her list is in reverse order. Complete the steps to combine them into one list as follows: **the contents of Drew's list, followed by Jamie's list in reverse order**, to get an accurate list of the students as they arrived.

```python
def combine_lists(list1, list2):
  return list2 + list1[::-1]
  
Jamies_list = ["Alice", "Cindy", "Bobby", "Jan", "Peter"]
Drews_list = ["Mike", "Carol", "Greg", "Marcia"]

print(combine_lists(Jamies_list, Drews_list))

# ['Mike', 'Carol', 'Greg', 'Marcia', 'Peter', 'Jan', 'Bobby', 'Cindy', 'Alice']
```

## Exercise 7: List Comprehension

Use a list comprehension to create a list of squared numbers (n*n). The function receives the variables start and end, and returns a list of squares of consecutive numbers between *start* and *end* **inclusively**. For example, squares(2, 3) should return [4, 9].tents of Drew's list, followed by Jamie's list in reverse order**, to get an accurate list of the students as they arrived.

```python
def squares(start, end):
	return [x**2 for x in range(start, end + 1)]

print(squares(2, 3)) # Should be [4, 9]
print(squares(1, 5)) # Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares(0, 10)) # Should be [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```
